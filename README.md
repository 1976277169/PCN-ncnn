### NOTICE (2018.12.12)

I strongly suggest you using ncnn in a early release. If you use a newer one, you will find that the speed of PCN is really slow.

# PCN-ncnn

Progressive Calibration Networks (PCN) is an accurate rotation-invariant face detector running at real-time speed on CPU, published in CVPR 2018.
